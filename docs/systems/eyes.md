# Eyes (System)

The eyes system is designed to interface with [Kevinbot v3's Eyes](https://github.com/meowmeowahr/KevinbotV3-Eyes).

It can use a serial link, or be used with the KevinbotLib Server over MQTT (reusing the same client as the [Kevinbot system](kevinbot.md)).

It does not contain any subsystems.
