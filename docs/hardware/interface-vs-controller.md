# Interfaces vs Controllers

## Interfaces

Interfaces are the low-level connectors to hardware interfaces such as Serial devices.

## Controllers

Controllers will take in an interface and apply a communication protocol to them.
An example of an interface would be a key-value communication system applied to a serial device.
